# Abacus Calculator 3D Simulator

Generated by Claude with prompts only, no manual code editing. Took 4 hours.
The program is about 1500 lines. When AI generates code over 1000 lines, it feels somewhat "unstable and hard to control". Therefore, much time was spent on adjustments.

## Overview
A web-based 3D visualization that combines traditional abacus with modern calculator functionality. Built with Three.js for 3D graphics and pure JavaScript for calculations.

## Features

### Visual Components
- **3D Abacus**: Interactive abacus model with realistic bead movements
- **Calculator Interface**: Basic calculator with numeric input and operations
- **Side Drawer**: Displays calculation steps and explanations

### Calculation Features
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- **Decimal Support**: Up to 4 decimal places
- **Number Limits**: Maximum 9 digits for integer part

### Animation & Visualization
- **Auto Demo**: Watch step-by-step bead movements
- **Highlight Effects**: Visual feedback when values match
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Detailed explanation in side drawer

### Interactive Features
- **Manual Control**: Direct manipulation of abacus beads
- **Calculator Input**: Standard calculator interface
- **Auto/Manual Switch**: Toggle between demonstration and manual operation

## Technical Highlights
